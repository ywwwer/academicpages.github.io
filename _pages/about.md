I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/). 
Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), in 2015.

My current research interests include machine learning and computer-aided design for VLSI.
I have interned at Synopsys, Cadence, and Toshiba Memory.
